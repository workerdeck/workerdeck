# WorkerDeck

Web-controlled Agent SDK session runner: embed, watch, and control a close-to-real Claude Code
session from a host app; a second, model-agnostic engine runs any AI SDK provider on the same
protocol. Read these before changing scope or structure:

- `docs/GOTCHAS.md` — **the invariants that bite.** Skim the headings for whatever you're about
  to touch: engine, permission, parking, bridge, packaging.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — package map, dependency rule, session/job/parking lifecycles.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — shipped / next / open questions. Non-goals (don't relitigate): serverless
  hosting, multi-tenant SaaS, claude.ai auth.

## Layout

- `packages/protocol` — wire types (events/commands/REST). Dependency-free, browser-safe, depends
  on nothing and everything depends on it. Breaking → bump `PROTOCOL_VERSION`.
- `packages/core` — the engines, shipped as **adapters** (`src/engines/`): one `EngineAdapter`
  per engine (capability record pinned by identity to protocol's `ENGINE_CAPABILITIES`, a model
  catalog versioned with the release, a credential-availability probe, a runner factory), looked
  up via `getEngineAdapter`. Three runners behind `Runner` (`src/runner-interface.ts`), which is
  what server and queue type against: `SessionRunner` (Claude, over the SDK's `query()`),
  `CodexRunner` (`engines/codex/` — the `@openai/codex` binary as an **optional peer**, driven
  over its `codex app-server` JSON-RPC surface: one child per *session* held across turns, a
  hand-rolled NDJSON client with zero new deps, token streaming, interactive approvals over the
  server→client ask channels (granular policy under `experimentalApi`, no fallback — a codex
  command approval is an *escalation after a sandbox refusal*, see `docs/GOTCHAS.md` §Codex),
  complete child env always — a spawn env *replaces*, never merges; and the `ThreadItem` union in
  `engines/codex/types.ts` must cover what the binary emits, because an unmapped item is
  **invisible**, not merely unstyled), and `AiSdkRunner`
  (provider, over AI SDK v7, built by the host's `createEngineRunner` hook — its adapter is a
  pseudo-adapter). The
  **model list clients see is shaped here**, not by each UI: catalogs apply
  `modelOptionsFromSdk`'s rules (`src/normalize.ts`) at authoring time — no `default` sentinel
  row, names derived from resolved ids (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` → "Haiku 4.5"), newest of
  each family `primary` — and the live `capabilities` event still exists for the in-session
  model switcher and slash commands (both truths are load-bearing, see `docs/GOTCHAS.md`).
  No transport. Tool execution rides the
  `ToolExecutor` seam (`QuickJsExecutor` in-process, `BrowserBridgeExecutor` to a tab,
  `DeferredExecutor` for work outliving the runner); `createToolContext` builds the
  capability-scoped tool set with the `sandboxed`/`authoritative` trust split; `park()` →
  `RunnerSnapshot` + `restore` are the two halves of rehydration.
- `packages/sandbox` — untrusted-code boundary: QuickJS-NG WASM guest, in-memory map VFS (not a
  node-fs emulation — the tab-side host runs it unpolyfilled), by-value host bridge,
  interpreter-enforced limits. Leaf like `protocol`; engine variant injected, so server and
  browser share one guest.
- `packages/queue` — `JobQueue` + `QueueAdapter` (in-memory bundled; `claimNext` must stay atomic
  and skip future `nextRunAt`). Concurrency, token budgets, webhooks, retries, watchdog, retention.
  Jobs are one-shot, but a run that parks frees its slot and stops its duration clock.
- `packages/server` — HTTP + WS gateway (`node:http` + `ws`): session registry, auth hook,
  profiles served with their engine's **capability record, static model catalog, and
  availability verdict** from the first request (`forResponse`; probes are adapter-run, gated on
  `checkCredentials`, ~60s TTL, display-only — only the *default* model is still learned from
  sessions, because it is the operator's CLI config),
  optional `/jobs` + `/queue` routes, profiles (+ `profileStore` CRUD), `GET /sessions/:id/files`,
  message attachments (`attachments.ts` — bytes held per session so the event log carries only
  `MessageAttachment` refs; **never** inline base64 into an event) and `/sessions/:id/mcp`
  (status + reconnect/enable/disable, with each server's `env`/`headers` stripped),
  the host-filesystem routes (`/fs/*`, `host-files.ts` + `host-file-search.ts` — operator
  privilege; reads follow `allowedCwdRoots` and `hostFiles.roots` only narrows, writes opt in
  separately; realpath-based containment and uniform-404 disclosure, so **do not** reuse
  `cwdAllowed` there — see `docs/GOTCHAS.md` §Host filesystem),
  capability-record request gating (`checkEngineGrants` 400s what the engine's record forswears;
  `stripInertFields` drops `questionBehavior` where no approval channel exists),
  `SessionNotifier` (`notifications.ts`) — server-wide session webhooks for the four
  human-attention moments, subscribed through `SessionRegistry`'s `onRegister` so a rebuilt
  parked session is covered too; transport-agnostic on purpose (no push credentials here),
  `SessionParkManager` (`parking.ts`) owning deferred execution over the `SessionStore` seam
  (`session-store.ts`: memory + JSON-file, the file one durable across restarts). Imports no model
  SDK — a provider profile is built by the host's `createEngineRunner` hook; claude and codex
  profiles go through core's adapters. A Claude profile pins
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` *except* when that would be a no-op — setting it at all moves the CLI off the
  macOS Keychain, so pinning the default dir breaks a working login (`docs/GOTCHAS.md`). A codex
  profile's `codexHome` pin has no such trap (the auth store is chosen by config *inside* the
  home) and is applied by the runner, not `buildRunnerConfig`, because codex replaces the child
  env wholesale. `checkCredentials` probes each profile at launch and on a ~60s TTL, and the
  verdicts serve `GET /profiles` as `available`/`unavailableReason` — display-only by design.
- `packages/client` — REST + WS client on platform `fetch`/`WebSocket`; zero runtime deps. Owns
  the WS frame surface, so new frames need `SessionHandle` methods/events here. A refused REST
  call throws `WorkerDeckError` (an `Error` subclass carrying `status`), which is what lets a
  caller tell "this server has no such route" (404 — stop asking) from "that file was too big".
- `packages/react` — headless: `useClaudeSession`, the pure transcript reducer
  (`src/transcript.ts`, framework-free, unit-tested — keep rendering out), the composer's two
  companions (`useAttachments` — staging + upload, filtered by the capability record;
  `useHostFileSearch` — `@file` search rooted at the session cwd, self-disabling on a 404), the
  other pure helpers that both clients must agree on (`rateLimitWindows`, `scanPromptTokens` —
  the mirror of the Swift `PromptTokens`), and the browser tool host (`tool-host.ts`) running
  server-bridged calls in the tab. Companions must ride the hook's own `handle` — the bridge asks
  the first attached client, so a second handle sees nothing. `TranscriptState.capabilities` is
  always populated, and is what every surface renders from (see `docs/GOTCHAS.md`).
- `packages/ui` — styled layer (Tailwind v4 + `@base-ui/react` + cva): `src/components/ui`
  primitives, `src/components/agent` components, vendored prompt-area composer (MIT). Ships source
  styles (`theme.css` + `@source`-scanned classnames; wiring in its README). `SessionPanel` is the
  whole session surface — transcript, composer (attachments, `/` and `@` completion), and the
  panels behind its status bar and `⋯` menu (session info, context, plan usage, MCP, project
  files) — each gated on the capability record, so one component is correct for every engine.
- `packages/web` — dashboard (TanStack Router, hash history); create forms are engine-aware via
  `src/lib/engine.ts`, reconciling sticky localStorage choices against the chosen profile. The
  session runner is `@workerdeck/ui`'s `SessionPanel` — the dashboard adds only the header, so a
  session feature belongs in `ui`/`react` and every embedder gets it too. Published
  as prebuilt static files with **zero runtime deps** — React/router/Tailwind are compiled into
  `dist/`, so every one of them is a devDep; the entry (`entry.mjs`, hand-written, never bundled) is
  a path to `dist/`, not a component. Two constraints are baked in at build time: no vite `base`, so
  it must mount at a domain root, and `location.origin + '/v1'`, so the gateway must be same-origin.
- `packages/cli` — published unscoped as **`workerdeck`**, the turnkey instance (`npx
  WorkerDeck`): gateway + dashboard on ONE port via the server's `fallback` hook. Single-origin
  is load-bearing, not cosmetic — a tab can't put a header on a WS handshake, so a cookie is the
  only credential it can present on an attach, and cookies are per-origin. `--auth-key` is one
  secret over two transports (login-page cookie for browsers, header for services); a config file
  supplying its own `authenticate` turns the built-in off entirely rather than layering. Loopback
  runs keyless; off loopback the CLI *generates* a key rather than serving open (persisted at
  `<stateDir>/auth-key`, 0600), and only an explicit `--insecure` / `insecureHosts` declaration
  serves unauthenticated — `insecureHosts` entries double as accepted Host headers. The
  resolve/materialize seam has an assert that must stay: see `docs/GOTCHAS.md`. The web
  dashboard is a real runtime dep on `@workerdeck/web` — `resolveWebRoot()` is just its exported
  `dashboardDir` — so there is one dashboard, versioned in lockstep, not a vendored copy. Also
  hosts `workerdeck guard`, and `src/apns/` — the **only push credential in the project**: a
  hand-rolled APNs client (`node:http2` + ES256 JWT, zero deps), a device registry mounted at
  `POST/DELETE /apns/devices` through the same `fallback` seam that serves the dashboard, and a
  forwarder hooked to `notifications.onNotification` in-process. It lives here and not in
  `server` so the OSS gateway stays credential-free; absent an `apns` config the routes 404 and
  the forwarder does not exist. Environment is per device token, never a flag —
  `docs/GOTCHAS.md` §APNs.
- `apps/docs` — Astro site → Pages via `docs.yml`. `examples` — dev entries with root-level deps
  the packages must not take, plus `dev-server.config.mjs`, which is what `pnpm server` runs: dev
  goes through the real CLI, so there is no second server entry point to keep in sync (config
  files here stay literal — no env indirection, they are meant to be edited). `docs/assets` —
  brand assets (rules in `BRAND.md`); the mark is inlined in `BrandMark.tsx`, `Header.astro` and
  both favicons — keep geometry identical.
- `apps/ios` — native iOS remote control (SwiftUI + XcodeGen; invisible to pnpm/turbo — no
  package.json). `WorkerDeckKit/` is a hand-written Swift mirror of `packages/protocol` plus a
  client and a port of the react transcript reducer — protocol or transcript changes must be
  mirrored there (`WorkerProtocol.version` tracks `PROTOCOL_VERSION`); see `apps/ios/README.md`.
  Zero third-party Swift deps — including for hot reload, where InjectionNext is wired in
  through its prebuilt bundle and a dozen lines of `HotReload.swift` rather than a package;
  auth is the header transport (no cookie machinery).
  **When you change the app, push it to the phone**: `apps/ios/scripts/deploy.sh` (build +
  install + launch, over Wi-Fi, no cable) — the point is that Tobias can follow along on the real
  device rather than read about a simulator screenshot. Add `--no-launch` and it works on a
  locked phone; launching needs it unlocked, and the script says so rather than dumping
  CoreDevice errors. For a screen that needs a live session to render at all, the `UIPREVIEW`
  harness renders it from canned data in the simulator. Both are documented in
  `apps/ios/README.md`.

Dependency direction: `protocol ← core ← queue ← server ← cli`, `protocol ← client ← react ← ui ← web`,
`sandbox` a leaf either side may use. The browser side (client/react/ui/apps) must never import
core/server, the Agent SDK, or any model SDK; `client` must never devDep on `react` — that edge is
the build-graph cycle turbo refuses.

## Tooling

pnpm workspace + turbo (`pnpm typecheck|test|build|lint`); typecheck is `tsgo` (TS 7 preview) and
covers `smoke/` + `examples/` too via `typecheck:extras` (they have tsconfigs but aren't packages,
so turbo never ran them); lint oxlint; `build/` via tsdown only on `prepack`/CI. Dev never builds
— the `@workerdeck/source` export condition resolves packages to `src/index.ts` (Node runs with
`--conditions=@workerdeck/source` + swc-node; Vite/vitest set `resolve.conditions`, vitest also
aliases). In-package imports use explicit `.ts` extensions. Releases go through **pnpm only** —
`npm publish` would ship `workspace:*` verbatim; see the packaging section of `docs/GOTCHAS.md`
before touching versioning or the publish workflow.

## Testing

`pnpm test` — core: fake `queryFn` harness (no CLI spawn) + a scripted JSON-RPC peer
(`connectFn`) for `CodexRunner`; server: real HTTP+WS integration incl. job routes + webhook
receiver (codex via the test-only `engines` adapter override); queue: fake runner; react:
reducer + bridge e2e.
Real-SDK smokes cost tokens and never run in `pnpm test`, but permission-path or
CLI-control-request changes need one — the fake harness can't validate those payloads — and **an
engine's process contract can't either**: any change to `CodexRunner`'s spawn options,
handshake, or event mapping needs `pnpm smoke:codex`. Smokes live in `smoke/`: `smoke:sandbox` and
`smoke:codex --canary` are free; `smoke:live`, `smoke:sdk`, `smoke:media` (the only check that
the CLI accepts image/PDF/text attachment blocks at all) and the full `smoke:codex` are not.

## Wrapup Config

- check: `pnpm lint` + `pnpm typecheck`
- test: `pnpm test`
- push: yes — branch `master`, repo is public, and every push deploys the docs site.
- version_bump: yes — `pnpm version:set <x.y.z> && pnpm install --lockfile-only` (the 10 packages
  only; `workspace:*` needs no bumping, so the lockfile step is a no-op). 0.9.0 on master
  (protocol 6 + the codex engine; it absorbed the never-published 0.8.0), 0.7.0 is the latest
  published — tag `v0.9.0` to release it.
- publish: yes — npm `@workerdeck` org, always through pnpm. Push a `v<x.y.z>` tag:
  `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs `pnpm publish -r` under npm trusted publishing (OIDC, no
  NPM_TOKEN, automatic provenance), re-running the full CI gate, refusing a tag that disagrees
  with `packages/*/package.json`, and skipping versions already on the registry — a half-failed
  run is safe to re-run, and a prerelease tag goes out under `next`. Manual fallback is `pnpm
  publish:all`. Gatekeeper audit first. MIT (ui ships `src/` — allowlisted in gatekeeper.json).
- docs: root CLAUDE.md + README.md + docs/ + apps/docs (keep site content in sync with README)
- frontend_smoke: no (manual via `pnpm server` + `pnpm web`)
- co_authored_by: no (global)

## Auth red lines (non-negotiable)

WorkerDeck implements NO model-provider auth: credentials are resolved by the official SDK/CLI
from the operator's environment. Never add — and reject any PR that adds — claude.ai OAuth flows
or login UI, subscription-token extraction/storage/forwarding, Claude Code client-identity
spoofing, or multi-account pooling / rate-limit circumvention. Policy enforcement lives in
configuration (`requireApiKey`, the one-time 'oauth' notice, `apiKeySource` on
SessionInfo/system_init), never in tampering with the credential chain. **The same principle
binds the Codex engine**: `codex login` (or `codex login --with-api-key`) is the operator's job
in their own terminal; WorkerDeck never invokes it, never reads `auth.json`, and never wires an
API key into the child or over the app-server's account RPCs — the operator's session env is
passed through whole, but no env key is a credential route on this surface (`CODEX_API_KEY` is
read only by `codex exec`, which we no longer ship; the canary pins that), so availability
comes from `codex login status` alone, and the probe surfaces exit codes and fixed reason
strings only, never `codex login status` output (it contains a masked key fragment). Compliance/legal review is in progress — keep the README "Auth & Anthropic's terms"
section's status honest as things settle; whether OpenAI's terms restrict headless
ChatGPT-subscription codex use the same way is unresolved and mirrors the same posture.
